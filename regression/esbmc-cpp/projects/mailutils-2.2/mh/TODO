The GNU implementation of MH is primarily aiming to provide an interface
between Mailutils and Emacs using mh-e module. Therefore, a subset of MH
utilities has been selected that would provide such basic functionality.
When this functionality is achieved, other utilities may be implemented.

Utilities Ordered by Importance
===============================

The `State' column gives the state of the given utility:

- Not implemented
+ Fully implemented
* Partially implemented. The `Comments' column lists the missing features.

The `Nice' column gives aproximate priority of the utility in the terms
of unix nice level (-20 the highest, +20 the lowest)

State	Nice	Utility		Comments
-------------------------------------------
+	-20	scan
+	-20	inc
*	-20	repl		--inplace,--whatnowproc
+	-20	comp		Interactive prompting.
*	-20	forw		--inplace,--whatnowproc

+	-15	folder(s)	
+	-15	mhn		
+	-10	rmf
+	0	install-mh	
*	4	mhl		Following format variables are ignored:
